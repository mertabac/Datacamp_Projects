## About the Author

I am an industrial engineering student at ITU. I am interested in data science and would like to work in this field. I have worked on several small-scale data science projects at school and have knowledge of methods such as data manipulation, data clustering, and data classification. I would like to develop my skills as a business analyst, data scientist, or data analyst in these fields. I am also interested in cloud computing systems and quantitative finance. I have a basic understanding of Git and NoSQL (MongoDB). I am continuously developing my skills to gain flexibility in my career and to gain a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of my work, which will allow me to pursue roles in database engineering and solution architecture. I am committed to advancing my abilities in these areas to ensure that I am always able to provide valuable contributions to my team and organization. Additionally, I understand the importance of continuously refining my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies.
